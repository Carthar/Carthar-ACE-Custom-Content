Adds a vendor WCID 2000015 Hobard.
He sells tokens that can change the aura of weapon and caster icons.   
This can make determining the element of the weapon easier, especially for AR, CB and CS imbued weapons.  
An example would be adding the aura of acid, which would make a faint green outline around the weapon icon.
The change has no impact on the 3D modle, just the icon in the player's pack.

Install:
Copy folder to the \ace\content\sql\  folder
Create and instance of WCID 200015, in game, where you want the vendor to be.
