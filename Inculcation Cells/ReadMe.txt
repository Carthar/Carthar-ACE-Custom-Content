This is a mini raid dungeon.
Lore wise it should be added after the Springs Sorrow custom content has been run at least once.

WARNING!  
This uses two landblocks.   
  - The dungeon Inculcation Cells Landblock 0295
  - The landblock 3129, near the obsidian plains where the normal portal to the Inculcation Cells is located.

The dungeon will have two states.   One that is base ace and the raid configuration when triggered.

The raid is timed to two hours.

Installation
Copy this folder into to your ace\content\sql\ folder
Create an instance of WCID 260101 Inculcation Cells StopGap Generator in an always active landblock.   Hebian-To next to all the other generators is a good option.

*** I still need to copy over the common monsters weenies


Note:  Some of the rewards are a custom currency that will be used in my upcoming content.
