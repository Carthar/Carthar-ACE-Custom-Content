This is a custom event inspred by the patch Spring's Sorrow.
The event is a virindi raid on Ayan Baqur, where the towns folks are abducted.

To install it, just copy this folder and all subfolders over to your ace\content\sql\   folder.

WARNING!  
This uses two landblocks.   
  -Ayan Baqur landblock 1134
  -Panopticon Dungeon landblock 02A1

If you already have custom content in Ayan Baqur, you will need to merge the files.
The content needed starts on GUID 0x71134A8C

The panopticon dungeon will look normal unless the event is ongoing.  

To start the event talk to the AB Raid Controller NPC in Ayan Baqur.   You will need adminvision to see him.
The difficulty of the town raid can be increase or decreased with the levers that will spawn around him.   So you can dynamically adjust the difficulty.
Once the town raid is done, the players need to find where the raiders have retreated to.   There are hints and if anyone knows the lore, they will know it is the panopticon.
The dungeon (Panopticon) is a self leveling dungeon.  It adjusts/steps up the difficulty based upon how many players enter.
