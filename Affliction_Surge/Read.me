Of all the aetheria surges, affliction is the least useful.   
150 damage over 19 seconds is tiny when you have to be a reasonably high level to activate even the lowest level blue aetheria.

This changes the aetheria affliction surge to make it also debuff damage resistance in the same way that void DoTs do.
My testing has that the damage resistance rating is lowered by about 3% when the surge procs.
The use case is intended to be against high level boss monsters where a minimal damage increase for a large party would make a difference.
